Python Challenge 

1. PyBank: Analysis derived from faux financial records from a file named budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. The objective was to create a Python script that analyzes the budget data and prints the results to both the terminal and to a .txt file located in a specified file path. Specific analytic requirements for this challenge are listed below:

  ✦ The total number of months included in the dataset<br/>
  ✦ The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period<br/>
  ✦ The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period and then identify the average of those changes<br/>
✦ The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period<br/>
✦ The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period<br/>

2. PyPoll: Analysis derived from faux poll data from file named election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. The objective was to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and prints the results to both the terminal and to a .txt file located in a specified file path. Specific analytic requirements for this challenge are listed below:

✦ The total number of votes cast<br/>
✦ A complete list of candidates who received votes<br/>
✦ The percentage of votes each candidate won<br/>
✦ The total number of votes each candidate won<br/>
✦ The winner of the election based on popular vote<br/>
