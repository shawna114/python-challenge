**Python Challenge**

**1. PyBank:** Analysis derived from faux financial records from a file named budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. The objective was to create a Python script that analyzes the budget data and prints the results to both the terminal and to a .txt file located in a specified file path. Specific analytic requirements for this challenge are listed below:

    ✦ The total number of months included in the dataset<br/>
    ✦ The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period<br/>
    ✦ The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period and then identify the average of those changes<br/>
    ✦ The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period<br/>
    ✦ The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period<br/>

    PyBank Results:

    Total: $38,382,578
    Total Months: 86
    Average Change: -$2,315.12
    Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-12 ($1,926,159)
    Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-13 (-$2,196,167)

**2. PyPoll:** Analysis derived from faux poll data from file named election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. The objective was to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and prints the results to both the terminal and to a .txt file located in a specified file path. Specific analytic requirements for this challenge are listed below:

    ✦ The total number of votes cast
    ✦ A complete list of candidates who received votes
    ✦ The percentage of votes each candidate won
    ✦ The total number of votes each candidate won
    ✦ The winner of the election based on popular vote
